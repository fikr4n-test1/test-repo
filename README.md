Search issues or pull requests

By default, GitHub search will return both issues and pull requests. However, you can restrict search results to just issues or pull requests using the type or is qualifier.

Scope the search fields

The in qualifier limits what fields are searched. With this qualifier you can restrict the search to just the title, body, comments, or any combination of these. Without the qualifier, the title, body, and comments are searched.
